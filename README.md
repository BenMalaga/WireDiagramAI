# WireDiagramAI
An AI program I made for image recognition and problem solving, the AI consists of two models, one for determining if a given wire diagram is dangerous, and one for determining which wire should be cut. Both models are based on a certain set of rules for what makes a diagram dangerous and what wire should be cut if it is dangerous.
